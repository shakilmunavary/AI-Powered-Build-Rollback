### Analysis of Jenkins Log and Jenkinsfile

#### Identified Pipeline-Related Errors:
1. **Typo in Maven Command:**
   The command `sh 'mvbbn clean package'` contains a typo. The correct command should be `sh 'mvn clean package'`.

2. **Maven Command Not Found:**
   The error log indicates that the `mvbbn` command was not found, which is expected since it's a typo.

3. **Git Checkout Issues:**
   The log shows warnings related to Git checkout, such as "Selected Git installation does not exist. Using Default" and "No credentials specified." These warnings suggest potential issues with the Git setup, but they did not cause the build to fail directly.

### Troubleshooting Recommendations:
1. **Fix the Typo:**
   Correct the typo in the Maven command from `mvbbn` to `mvn`.

2. **Verify Maven Installation:**
   Ensure that Maven is correctly installed and accessible in the PATH on the Jenkins agent.

3. **Check Git Configuration:**
   Verify that the Git installation is correctly configured in Jenkins. Ensure that the correct Git tool is selected and that any necessary credentials are provided.

### Fixed Jenkinsfile:
Below is the corrected Jenkinsfile with the typo fixed and ensuring it adheres to standard declarative pipeline syntax.

```groovy
pipeline {
    agent any

    stages {
        stage('Clone Repository') {
            steps {
                git 'https://github.com/shakilmunavary/AI-Powered-Jenkins-BuildFailure-Management.git'
            }
        }

        stage('Build with Maven') {
            steps {
                sh 'mvn clean package'  // Corrected the typo here
            }
        }

        stage('Run Tests') {
            steps {
                sh 'mvn test'
            }
        }

        stage('Deploy') {
            steps {
                echo 'Deploying the application...'
                // Add deployment steps here (e.g., copying .jar/.war files)
            }
        }
    }

    post {
        failure {
            script {
                // Print the error message
                echo "Pipeline failed with error: ${currentBuild.rawBuild.getLog(100).join('\n')}"
            }
        }
    }
}
```

### Additional Recommendations:
1. **Ensure Maven is Installed:**
   Make sure Maven is installed on the Jenkins agent and that the `mvn` command is available in the PATH.

2. **Configure Git Tool:**
   In the Jenkins configuration, ensure that the Git tool is correctly set up. Go to `Manage Jenkins` > `Global Tool Configuration` and verify that the Git installation is correctly specified.

3. **Check Credentials:**
   If your repository requires credentials, ensure that they are correctly configured in Jenkins. You can add credentials in `Manage Jenkins` > `Manage Credentials` and use them in the `git` step if needed.

4. **Test the Pipeline:**
   After making these changes, run the pipeline again to verify that the issues are resolved.

By following these recommendations, you should be able to resolve the errors and successfully run your Jenkins pipeline.
